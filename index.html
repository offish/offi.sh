                <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci
                    velit..."
                    "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it
                    is pain..."
                    What is Lorem Ipsum?
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard
                    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
                    make a type specimen
                    book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                    remaining essentially
                    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                    Ipsum passages, and more
                    recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                    looking at its
                    layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                    as opposed to using
                    'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
                    and web page
                    editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
                    many web sites
                    still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                    sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).

                <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                    Latin literature
                    from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                    College in Virginia,
                    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
                    through the cites of
                    the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33
                    of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
                    book is a treatise
                    on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
                    ipsum dolor sit
                    amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                    Sections 1.10.32 and
                    1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                    accompanied by
                    English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                    alteration in some form,
                    by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to
                    use a passage of
                    Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
                    Lorem Ipsum
                    generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
                    generator on the
                    Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
                    structures, to
                    generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
                    repetition,
                    injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
